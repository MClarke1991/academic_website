# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am interested in computational modelling of gene regulatory networks in cancer, particularly in breast cancer and glioblastoma (GBM). My work focuses on the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, how mutations cause it to malfunction leading to cancer and predicting treatment effects to find optimal and novel therapies. Beyond treatment response, I am investigating the potential of network models to predict the evolution of cancer and specifically whether we can use gene regulatory network models to predict the order of the acquisition of mutations during tumorigenesis, and the emergence of resistance after targeted therapy.
